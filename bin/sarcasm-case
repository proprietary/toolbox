Sarcasm case
------------

Sarcasm case is a form of text manipulation where the goal is to make
a given text appear sarcastic. To do this, the case of each letter in
the text is randomly chosen. For example, the sentence "I am not
sarcastic" would become "i aM NoT SaRcAsTiC".

This program reads a string from the standard input and outputs it in
"sarcasm case" to the standard output.
